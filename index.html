<h1 style="color:blue;">About Software</h1>
<p>    Software engineering (SE) is the profession concerned with specifying, designing, developing and maintaining software applications by applying technologies and practices from computer science, project management, and other fields.SE applications are used in a wide range of activities, from industry to entertainment. Software applications improve user productivity and quality of life. Application software examples: office suites, video games, and the world wide web. System software examples: embedded systems and operating systems.SE technologies and practices improve the productivity of developers and the quality of the applications they create. Software engineering examples: databases, languages, libraries, patterns, and tools.Typical senior-level software engineers have an advanced degree and have ten or more years of experience. Note that these are only guidelines that are trends seen in hiring practices and that many exceptions exist.Software engineering is the practice of creating software.</p>
<p>     Software engineering is the practice of creating software.Members of this profession are called software engineers, programmers, developers, or practitioners.People who write code and do not follow the doctrines of software engineering are more accurately called programmers, developers, or software artists.In the U.S., software drove about 1/4 of all increase in GDP during the 1990s (about $90 billion per year), and 1/6 of all productivity growth (efficiency within GDP) during the late 1990s (about $33 billion per year). Software engineering drove $1 trillion of economic and productivity growth over the last decade.People who write code and do not follow the doctrines of software engineering are more accurately called programmers, developers, or software artists.</p>

<h3 style="color:indigo;">The various types of software are listed below</h3>
<p style="color:purple;">Application Software:.</p>
<pApplication software is built to perform specific tasks.<br>
High-level languages are used for the development of application software.<br>
Application software can be of two types<br>
1.Generic application software<br>
2.Customized application software<br>
Application software interacts directly with the users.<br>
Examples of application software are Microsoft office suite, real-time virtual meeting software, etc..</p>
<p style="color:orange;">System Software:.</p>
<pSystem software manages the resources of the system.<br>
A computer system cannot function without system software.<br>
Low-level language is used to build such software.<br>
The best example of system software is operating systems and their peripherals, device drivers, language processors, etc..</p>
